# Data-Structures-Final-Project

You have been hired to develop a Java program to keep track of team statistics for a soccer league. As game scores are reported, the program is to keep track of team records and related statistics. Your assignment is to develop the LeagueStats class, as described below. Game scores will be stored in a comma-separated (.csv) file. Each line contains the following information about a game, with items being separated by commas:
Home Team,Away Team,Home Goals,Away Goals
You are free to store team and game information in any suitable data structure(s) of your choice, but keep in mind that the actual file may be much larger than the one provided for testing.
